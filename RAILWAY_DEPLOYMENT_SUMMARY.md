# Railway Deployment Preparation Summary

Your StreamFlix application has been prepared for deployment on Railway. Here's a summary of the changes and configurations made:

## Files Created

1. **railway.json** - Main Railway configuration file with:
   - Build configuration using Dockerfile
   - Deployment settings with restart policies

2. **Dockerfile** - Docker configuration for containerized deployment:
   - Uses Node.js 20 alpine as base image to satisfy cross-env requirements
   - Updates package-lock.json to match package.json
   - Installs production dependencies with --legacy-peer-deps flag to resolve conflicts
   - Builds the application
   - Configures the start command

3. **.dockerignore** - Optimizes Docker build by excluding unnecessary files

4. **RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Detailed deployment guide

5. **RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md** - This summary file

## Key Configuration Details

### Build Process
- Uses the existing `npm run build` script which:
  - Builds the client-side React application with Vite
  - Bundles the server-side code with esbuild
- Output directory: `dist/`

### Deployment
- Start command: `npm run start`
- Port configuration: Uses the PORT environment variable provided by Railway
- Restart policy: Restarts on failure, up to 10 times

### Environment Variables
The following variables should be configured in your Railway project settings:
- DATABASE_URL (postgresql://postgres:GriCZZNCRTLbKetAZrDcMVsBZAhIgILU@maglev.proxy.rlwy.net:52057/railway)
- JWT_SECRET
- TMDB_API_KEY
- LYGOS_API_KEY
- PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID
- PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET
- EMAIL_USER
- EMAIL_PASS
- CLIENT_URL (automatically provided by Railway)
- BASE_URL (automatically provided by Railway)

## Deployment Steps

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Import the project to Railway
3. Add a PostgreSQL database service
4. Configure the environment variables in Railway project settings
5. Deploy!

## Notes

- Your existing .env file was not modified as requested in the previous task
- The configuration supports both the REST API and client-side React application
- Railway will automatically handle SSL certificates for your deployment
- The deployment is optimized for Railway's infrastructure
