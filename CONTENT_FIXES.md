# Content Fetching Fixes

## Problem
When users clicked on certain movies or TV shows, they would see a "not found" error even though the TMDB data was available. This happened because:

1. The content database didn't have entries for all TMDB IDs
2. Some content entries existed but didn't have video URLs
3. The API was returning 404 errors instead of graceful fallbacks

## Solution
We implemented the following fixes:

### Backend Changes
1. **Modified `/api/contents/tmdb/:tmdbId` endpoint**:
   - Instead of returning 404 errors, it now returns a default content object with empty video URL
   - This allows the frontend to handle missing content gracefully
   - Added consistent error handling that returns default objects instead of throwing errors

2. **Updated both admin and server routes**:
   - Made the behavior consistent between both implementations
   - Ensured that content without video URLs is handled properly

### Frontend Changes
1. **Improved error handling in `watch-movie.tsx` and `watch-tv.tsx`**:
   - Modified the `useQuery` hooks to return default content objects instead of throwing errors
   - Updated UI messages to be more user-friendly
   - Added better explanations about Zupload-only support

2. **Enhanced user experience**:
   - Clearer messages when content is not available
   - Better guidance on what types of videos are supported
   - Consistent design between movie and TV show pages

## Testing
To test the fixes:

1. Try accessing a movie or TV show that doesn't exist in the content database
2. Verify that you see a friendly message instead of an error
3. Check that navigation back to the home page works correctly
4. Confirm that Zupload videos still work as expected

## Files Modified
- `backend/routes/admin.js` - Updated content fetching endpoint
- `server/routes.ts` - Updated content fetching endpoint  
- `client/src/pages/watch-movie.tsx` - Improved error handling and UI
- `client/src/pages/watch-tv.tsx` - Improved error handling and UI

## How It Works
When a user tries to watch a movie or TV show:

1. The frontend requests content data from `/api/contents/tmdb/:tmdbId`
2. If the content exists and has a video URL, it's returned normally
3. If the content doesn't exist, a default object is returned instead of a 404 error
4. If the content exists but has no video URL, it's returned with an empty URL
5. The frontend displays a friendly message explaining the situation
6. Users can easily navigate back to the home page

This approach provides a much better user experience than showing generic error messages.
