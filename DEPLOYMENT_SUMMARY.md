# Vercel Deployment Preparation Summary

Your StreamFlix application has been prepared for deployment on Vercel. Here's a summary of the changes and configurations made:

## Files Created/Modified

1. **vercel.json** - Main Vercel configuration file with:
   - Build configuration for the Node.js server
   - Routing rules for API endpoints and client-side routes
   - Security headers for enhanced protection

2. **.env.production** - Template for production environment variables:
   - Database configuration
   - JWT secret
   - API keys for TMDB, Lygos, and PayPal
   - Email configuration
   - Client and base URLs

3. **.vercelignore** - Optimizes deployment by excluding:
   - Test files and documentation
   - Development tools and logs
   - Backend directory (not needed for Vercel deployment)
   - Diagnostic and verification scripts

4. **DEPLOYMENT_VERCEL.md** - Detailed deployment guide with:
   - Step-by-step deployment instructions
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Troubleshooting tips

## Key Configuration Details

### Build Process
- Uses the existing `npm run build` script which:
  - Builds the client-side React application with Vite
  - Bundles the server-side code with esbuild
- Output directory: `dist/`

### Routing
- API routes (`/api/*`) are handled by the Node.js server
- All other routes are served from the static client build
- Client-side routing is supported with proper fallback to index.html

### Environment Variables
The following variables need to be configured in your Vercel project settings:
- DATABASE_URL
- JWT_SECRET
- TMDB_API_KEY
- LYGOS_API_KEY
- PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID
- PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET
- EMAIL_USER
- EMAIL_PASS
- CLIENT_URL
- BASE_URL

## Deployment Steps

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Import the project to Vercel
3. Configure the environment variables in Vercel project settings
4. Deploy!

## Notes

- Your existing .env file was not modified as requested
- The configuration supports both the REST API and client-side React application
- Security headers have been added for enhanced protection
- The deployment is optimized to exclude unnecessary files
